# Tickler

When professionally networking, there is a need to keep contacts straight and schedule follow ups.

This app attempts solve this problem by allowing you to create contacts, share them with your organization, take notes, set a follow up schedule, and an agenda of manual and automatic tasks.

Additionally, each individual or group can choose to get a number. For individuals, that can be redirected to another number. For groups, that number can be allocated to multiple phones, exchanged among them (one person on call), or put to a voice mail if no one picks up/is assigned.
